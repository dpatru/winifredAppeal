\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}


This is just to let you know that I have five Tax-Tribunal cases which have been put on hold waiting for a decision in this case (\coaNo). The issues in those cases involve Mathieu-Gast nonconsideration (MCL 211.27(2)) and this Court's guidance from this case will be helpful in those cases.

The case numbers of the waiting cases are: 18-002532, 18-002570, 18-002661, 18-002662, and 18-002664. 

I certify that when I submitted this letter to the court, I also served opposing counsel of \coaNo\ by electronic service.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
