This Court's decision is reasoned as follows:

\subsection{Mathieu Gast does not apply for repairs done in the year of a transfer}

MCL 211.27(2) did not prohibit the assessor from considering the impact
of any ``normal repairs'' on the property's TCV for purposes of the 2016 tax year because there was a transfer of ownership of the
subject property in 2015. \pincite{Patru 2}{3}.

\begin{quotation}
  Initially, we agree with the Tax Tribunal that because there was a transfer of ownership of the
subject property in 2015, MCL 211.27(2) did not prohibit the assessor from considering the impact
of any ``normal repairs'' on the property's TCV for purposes of the 2016 tax year.

The taxable status of real property for a given tax year is ``determined as of each December
31 of the immediately preceding year.'' MCL 211.2(2). Generally, property is assessed at 50% of
its true cash value[.]'' MCL 211.27a(1). However, the ``taxable value'' of property is subject to
``capping,'' meaning it is limited to the property's taxable value in the immediately preceding year,
subject to certain allowable adjustments. MCL 211.27a(2)(a); Const 1963, art 9, \S 3. (footnote 2:
``[B]efore ownership of property is transferred, its taxable value may increase no more than the
lesser of the rate of inflation or five percent.'' Lyle Schmidt Farms, LLC v Mendon Twp, 315 Mich
App 824, 831; 891 NW2d 43 (2016). Once ownership of the property is transferred, its taxable
value is ``uncapped,'' see id., and its taxable value for the year following the transfer is determined
by the property's actual value, MCL 211.27a(3).)

 However,
upon a transfer of ownership of property, the taxable value is ``uncapped,'' meaning ``the property's
taxable value for the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property's state
equalized valuation for the calendar year following the transfer.'' MCL 211.27a(3). The taxable
value does not become capped again until the end of the calendar year following the transfer of
ownership. MCL 211.27a(4); Michigan Props, LLC v Meridian Twp, 491 Mich 518, 530; 817
NW2d 548 (2012). Thus, because petitioner purchased the property in 2015 (i.e., there was a
transfer of ownership), the property's taxable value for the 2016 tax year was to be determined by
its actual assessed value as of December 31, 2015, without regard to any capping limitations.

While MCL 211.27(2) does not expressly provide that it does not apply to ``normal repairs''
performed during a year when ownership of property is transferred (i.e., the taxable value becomes
uncapped), the statute must be read in conjunction with other provisions of the General Property
-4-
Tax Act, MCL 211.1 et seq., and Const 1963, art 9, \S 3. See Bloomfield Twp v Kane, 302 Mich
App 170, 176; 839 NW2d 505 (2013) (statutes that relate to the same matter are considered to be
in pari materia and must be read together as a whole). It is apparent that MCL 211.27(2) was
adopted to distinguish ``normal repairs'' or property maintenance from other improvements (e.g.,
``additions'') that increase the value of property as long as the property is owned by the same party.
In Toll Northville LTD v Twp of Northville, 480 Mich 6, 12; 743 NW2d 902 (2008), our Supreme
Court, quoting WPW Acquisition Co v City of Troy, 466 Mich 117, 121-122; 643 NW2d 692
(2001), observed that the purpose of Const 1963, art 9, \S 3, as amended in 1994 by Proposal A, is

\begin{quote}
to generally limit increases in property taxes on a parcel of property, as long as it
remains owned by the same party, by capping the amount that the ``taxable value''
of the property may increase each year , even if the ``true cash value,'' that is, the
actual market value, of the property rises at a greater rate. However, a qualification
is made to allow adjustments for ``additions.''
\end{quote}

As indicated, however, when property is sold, it becomes ``uncapped'' and the property's value for
the following tax year is determined by its value as of December 31 of the preceding year. In other
words, the property's TCV for the tax year following a transfer of ownership is determined by its
value as of December 31 of the calendar year in which the transfer of ownership occurred.
Accordingly, the restriction on consideration of ``normal repairs'' for purposes of calculating
increases in TCV is intended to apply only while property is owned by the same party, and thus
would not apply to repairs performed during a year in which ownership of the property is
transferred. Rather, the taxable value of property for the tax year following a transfer of ownership
would be 50% of the property's TCV as of December 31 of the immediately preceding year (i.e.,
the year there was a transfer of ownership). MCL 211.2(2); MCL 211.27a(1) and (3).

TCV ``means the usual selling price at the place where the property to which the term is
applied is at the time of assessment, being the price that could be obtained for the property at a
private sale, and not at auction sale except as otherwise provided in this section, or at forced sale.''
MCL 211.27(1). TCV is synonymous with fair market value. Pontiac Country Club v Waterford
Twp, 299 Mich App 427, 434-435; 830 NW2d 785 (2013).

Because petitioner purchased the subject property in August 2015, the taxable value of the
property became uncapped between August 2015 and December 31, 2015, and, for the 2016 tax
year, the assessor was required to determine the property's TCV as of December 31, 2015.
Petitioner argues that under MCL 211.27(2), respondent can consider the value added by ``normal
repairs'' only when petitioner sells the property, because the statute states that ``[t]he assessor shall
not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs,
replacement, and maintenance in determining the true cash value of property for assessment
purposes until the property is sold.''While this interpretation may be correct with respect to repairs
made during a tax year in which there is no transfer of ownership, it cannot apply to repairs made
during a year in which there was a transfer of ownership because ``the property's taxable value for
the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property's state equalized valuation for
the calendar year following the transfer,'' MCL 211.27a(3), which in turn is ``determined as of each
December 31 of the immediately preceding year,'' MCL 211.2(2). Thus, the tribunal correctly
held that it was required to determine the TCV of the subject property on the basis of its fair market 
-5-
value as of December 31, 2015, regardless of any ``normal repairs'' made by petitioner in 2015
after he purchased the property.
\end{quotation}

\subsection{The law of the case does not apply here}

This case is not governed by \cite[s]{Patru 1}\ because ``this Court did not resolve whether petitioner's 2015 repairs to the property could or could not be considered in determining the property's TCV for the 2016 tax year, but instead
determined that ``further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the repairs were normal
repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2).'' . . . More significantly, this Court
did not address the effect of the property's transfer of ownership in 2015 on the tribunal's
consideration of ``normal repairs'' under MCL 211.27(2) for purposes of the 2016 tax year.
Because this issue was not actually addressed and decided in the prior appeal, the law-of-the-case
doctrine does not apply.'' \pincite{Patru 2}{5}.

\subsection{The Tribunal did not err in finding that the repairs did not have bearing on the property's condition}

Petitioner further argues that the tribunal erred by also finding that, regardless of the proper
construction of MCL 211.27(2), petitioner's repairs did not have any bearing on the property's
TCV, which was determined to be \$50,400 as of December 31, 2015. We again disagree. The
tribunal did not credit petitioner's argument that the property was in substandard condition when
he purchased it. The tribunal reviewed petitioner's Multiple Listing Service (MLS) printouts and
photographs for both the subject property and comparable properties. The tribunal found that
petitioner's MLS listing for the subject property showed a property in ``average'' condition, and
that petitioner's photographs of the property, before any repairs, showed ``a property that is livable
and habitable with reasonable marketability and appeal.'' The tribunal noted that the purpose of
petitioner's repairs was ``to ready the property as a tenant rental.'' It is undisputed that the assessed
TCV of the property for the 2015 tax year was \$48,000. Given this evidence, it was appropriate
for the tribunal to draw conclusions about the value of the property before and after petitioner's
purchase, specifically, that the prior year's assessment of \$48,000 was reflective of the property's
TCV before petitioner purchased it, that an increase of \$2,400 could be attributed to inflation and 
increases in the market, and that petitioner's ``normal repairs'' were not attributable to the
property's substandard condition, but rather were intended primarily to prepare the property as
rental property. The tribunal concluded that the ``evidence supports the property's assessment as
a property in average condition both at the time Petitioner acquired it and after he completed the
normal repairs,''and that ``the assessment did not consider the increase in true cash value that was
the result of normal repairs.''

\subsection{The Law of the Case does not apply here}
\begin {quotation}
  Petitioner seems to rely on the law-of-the-case doctrine to argue that under Patru I, the
tribunal was required to determine whether petitioner's repairs qualified as ``normal repairs'' and
was further prohibited from considering the impact of any ``normal repairs'' in determining the
property's TCV for purposes of the 2016 tax year. In \pincite{Lenawee Co}{149-150}, 
%Lenawee Co v Wagley, 301 Mich App 134, 149-150; 836 NW2d 193 (2013),
this Court explained:

\begin{quote}
  ``The law of the case doctrine holds that a ruling by an appellate court on a
particular issue binds the appellate court and all lower tribunals with respect to that
issue.'' New Props, Inc v George D Newpower, Jr, Inc, 282 Mich App 120, 132;
762 NW2d 178 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). ``[I]f an appellate
court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case for further proceedings,
the legal questions thus determined by the appellate court will not be differently
determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case where the facts remain
materially the same.'' Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration in
original). The doctrine is applicable ``only to issues actually decided, either
implicitly or explicitly, in the prior appeal.'' Grievance Administrator v Lopatin,
462 Mich 235, 260; 612 NW2d 120 (2000). ``The primary purpose of the doctrine
is to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during
the course of a single continuing lawsuit.'' Ashker v Ford Motor Co, 245 Mich App
9, 13; 627 NW2d 1 (2001).
\end{quote}

In Patru I, this Court did not resolve whether petitioner's 2015 repairs to the property could or
could not be considered in determining the property's TCV for the 2016 tax year, but instead
determined that ``further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the repairs were normal
repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2).'' Id., unpub op at 5. More significantly, this Court
did not address the effect of the property's transfer of ownership in 2015 on the tribunal's
consideration of ``normal repairs'' under MCL 211.27(2) for purposes of the 2016 tax year.
Because this issue was not actually addressed and decided in the prior appeal, the law-of-the-case
doctrine does not apply.

Petitioner further argues that the tribunal erred by also finding that, regardless of the proper
construction of MCL 211.27(2), petitioner's repairs did not have any bearing on the property's
TCV, which was determined to be \$50,400 as of December 31, 2015. We again disagree. The
tribunal did not credit petitioner's argument that the property was in substandard condition when
he purchased it. The tribunal reviewed petitioner's Multiple Listing Service (MLS) printouts and
photographs for both the subject property and comparable properties. The tribunal found that
petitioner's MLS listing for the subject property showed a property in ``average'' condition, and
that petitioner's photographs of the property, before any repairs, showed ``a property that is livable
and habitable with reasonable marketability and appeal.'' The tribunal noted that the purpose of
petitioner's repairs was ``to ready the property as a tenant rental.'' It is undisputed that the assessed
TCV of the property for the 2015 tax year was \$48,000. Given this evidence, it was appropriate
for the tribunal to draw conclusions about the value of the property before and after petitioner's
purchase, specifically, that the prior year's assessment of \$48,000 was reflective of the property's
TCV before petitioner purchased it, that an increase of \$2,400 could be attributed to inflation and 
-6-
increases in the market, and that petitioner's ``normal repairs'' were not attributable to the
property's substandard condition, but rather were intended primarily to prepare the property as
rental property. The tribunal concluded that the ``evidence supports the property's assessment as
a property in average condition both at the time Petitioner acquired it and after he completed the
normal repairs,'' and that ``the assessment did not consider the increase in true cash value that was
the result of normal repairs.''
We reject petitioner's argument that the tribunal was required to calculate the property's
TCV using a ``before repairs'' appraisal and an ``after repairs'' appraisal. Petitioner's reliance on
the State Tax Commission's 2014 Bulletin No. 7 in support of this argument is misplaced. Indeed,
page 3 of the Bulletin states:

\begin{quote}
The exemption for normal repairs, replacements and maintenance ends in
the year after the owner who made the repairs, replacements and maintenance sells
the property. In the year following a sale, the assessed value shall be based on the
true cash value of the entire property. The amount of assessment increase
attributable to the value of formerly exempt property returning to the assessment
roll is new for equalization purposes. [Emphasis added.] 
\end{quote}

As already explained, because the taxable value of the subject property was uncapped due to the
transfer of ownership in 2015, and respondent was permitted to assess the property on the basis of
its actual TCV as of December 31, 2015, there was no need to determine the property's values
before and after petitioner's ``normal repairs'' in 2015.
\end{quotation}

\subsection{The tribunal made its own independent determination}

Petitioner also argues that the tribunal erred by failing to make its own independent
determination of the property's TCV. See Jones \& Laughlin Steel Corp v City of Warren, 193
Mich App 348, 354-356; 483 NW2d 416 (1992). The record does not support this argument. The
tribunal evaluated the evidence and proposed valuation methods offered by both parties. The
tribunal found that ``[r]espondent's sales comparison approach is the most reliable and credible
valuation evidence which also supports the assessment and 2016 uncapping of the subject
property.'' The tribunal did not just automatically accept respondent's valuation. Rather, it
analyzed respondent's sales-comparison data and found that ``a reasoned and reconciled
determination of market value is obtainable from Respondent's sales,'' which it concluded
``supports the assessment and 2016 uncapping of the subject property.''


\subsection{The Tribunal properly rejected the sale}

Petitioner further argues that the tribunal erred by rejecting his 2015 purchase price of the
property as determinative of its TCV. MCL 211.27(6) provides:
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (7), the purchase price paid in a
transfer of property is not the presumptive true cash value of the property
transferred. In determining the true cash value of transferred property, an assessing
officer shall assess that property using the same valuation method used to value all
other property of that same classification in the assessing jurisdiction. As used in
this subsection and subsection (7), ``purchase price'' means the total consideration
agreed to in an arms-length transaction and not at a forced sale paid by the purchaser
of the property, stated in dollars, whether or not paid in dollars.
-7-
In this case, the tribunal considered petitioner's evidence of the 2015 purchase price for the
property, but it also considered the nature of the sale, which involved a bank sale in which the
grantor was the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The tribunal found
that the seller was not necessarily motivated to receive market value for the property and that the
property's purchase price was not presumptive of its TCV. The tribunal instead gave greater
weight to the evidence submitted by respondent in support of its sales-comparison approach to
valuation, which was based on sales of five properties similar in age and with comparable square
footage, style, siding, and condition. The tribunal found that respondent's evidence provided ``the
most reliable and credible valuation evidence'' and supported respondent's assessment of the
subject property. 

\section{Issues}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the subject's sale comform to the sales comparision approach, one of the three recognized methods of valuation?
  
\item Does \cite[s]{MCL 211.27(6)}\ bar the Tribnual from using the subject's sale to set its true cash value?
  
\item Where the Tribunal based its valuation on the subject's sale along with two other comparable sales, did the Tribunal err when did not discount the subject's sale price because of market decline even though it discounted the comparables?

\section{Facts}
\label{facts}
\subsection{Appellant buys the house, repairs it, and appeals its assessment}

Appellant purchased the subject house in August 2015 for \$32,000. The house was sold by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through a real estate broker who had listed the house on the MLS. \mlsListing[]. At the time of purchase, the house needed numerous repairs, most of which were required by the City to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy. \repairs[]. By tax day, 12/31/2015, Appellant had repaired the house and rented it. \foj[4-5].

The City of Wayne assessed the house on tax day at \$50,400 true cash value, rather than the \$32,000 purchase price. \boardOfReviewDecision.

Appellant appealed to the Board of Review and then to the Tax Tribunal. Appellant does not dispute that the house was worth \$50,400 on tax day in its repaired condition. But he contends that under \mathieuGast\ the repairs were normal repairs and that the true cash value for assessment purposes cannot include the value of the repairs. He contends that the correct true cash value is therefore the before-repair value. \explanatoryLetter[2].

Appellant contends that the best evidence of the house's before-repair value is its sale price of \$32,000 when it was unrepaired. Id. The house was marketed in the normal way and for a sufficient time. Licensed real estate brokers listed the house on the MLS, initially for \$29,900 on 4/3/2013 and later for \$32,000 on 6/17/2015. Before Appellant bought the property there had been at least two accepted offers on the property that failed to close. \mlsHistory[]. 

The City contends that the true cash value should be the after-repair value. \cityEvidence.

\subsection{The Tribunal refuses to apply nonconsideration but this Court reverses}

The Referee who first heard the case at the Tribunal refused to apply nonconsideration. She held that the repairs were not normal repairs because the house was in substandard condition. ``Thus, the referee determined that if a property is purchased in substandard condition, any repairs done on the property to bring it into good repair do not constitute normal repairs, maintenance, or replacement within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2), so the increase in TCV resulting from those repairs can be immediately considered in determining the TCV for assessment purposes.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{2}.

This Court reversed. ``Nothing in MCL 211.27(2) provides that the repairs .~.~. are not normal repairs in the event that they are performed on a substandard property. Thus, by reading a requirement into the statute that was not stated by the legislature, the trial court erred .~.~.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}.

This Court remanded for a rehearing to determine if the repairs were normal repairs because ``[t]he referee did not fully evaluate that evidence---which included testimony---because [she] misapprehended how to properly apply MCL 211.27(2).'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}.

\subsection{On rehearing, the Tribunal again refuses to apply nonconsideration}

The rehearing was held on 10/18/2018 before Tribunal Judge Marcus L. Abood. He ruled that the repairs were normal repairs, worth approximately \$10,000. \foj[4]. However, he went on to rule on pages 5 and 6 of the FOJ that ``Petitioner's contentions related to his purchase price and `normal' repairs are given no weight or credibility in the determination of market value'' because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The property's assessment for 2016 changed based on the sale transaction in August 2015 and not based on Petitioner's repairs. 
\item The assessment considered the property in average condition as it was on 12/31/2015, tax day.
\item The MLS photographs submitted by Petitioner show the property in average condition, not neglected or vandalized.
\item The property's sale was not ``an arm's length sale transaction'' because the Petitioner has not claimed it so and because the seller was HUD.
\end{enumerate}

Judge Abood did not determine the property's before-repair value. Instead, he ruled that the property must be valued in its repaired condition because it was repaired before tax day. \foj[5]. He accepted the City's comparative sales analysis, writing: ``Respondent's sales adjustment grid does not included a line-item entry for repairs. This comparative analysis is devoid of any relationship to Petitioner's ``normal'' repairs to subject property which occurred before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and the December 31, 2015 tax day.'' \foj[6].

\subsection{Appellant files a Motion for Reconsideration}

Appellant responded to the FOJ with a motion for reconsideration. The motion points out that this Court reversed the previous judgment of the Tribunal because  ``the referee's finding that the property's TCV was \$50,400 was based on its assessment of the property's value after it had been repaired.'' \motionForReconsideration[1]. The Tribunal was repeating the mistake, except this time after admitting that the repairs were normal repairs. Id.\ p 2. 

The Motion for Reconsideration also pointed out that the Tribunal had not done before-repair and after-repair appraisals as required by \mathieuGast. Id.\ p 4.

The Motion for Reconsideration also pointed out flaws in the four reasons given in the FOJ for giving no weight or credibility to Appellant's contentions related to his purchase price and normal repairs. Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The FOJ claimed the property's assessment changed based on the sale transaction. Appellant pointed out that assessments are not based on sales but rather are done yearly. The property \emph{uncapped} as a result of the sale, but Appellant had no issue with uncapping. Id.\ p 4.

\item The FOJ claimed the assessment considered the property in average condition as it was on 12/31/2015, tax day. Appellant pointed out that this does not invalidate \mathieuGast\ which requires the removal of the contribution of normal repairs to the assessed value. Id.\ p 5. 

\item The FOJ claimed that the MLS photographs submitted by Petitioner show the property in average condition, not neglected or vandalized. Appellant pointed out that photos do not excuse performance of \mathieuGast; nor do they contradict the fact that the City itself inspected the house and required repairs; nor do the photos, put in the MLS by the real estate brokers who listed and sold the house, show that the house was listed and sold at a non-market price. Id. p 5.
  
\item The FOJ claimed that the property's sale was not an arm's length sale transaction because the Petitioner has not claimed it so and because the seller was HUD. Appellant pointed out that he had included MLS data to show that the property's sale was a market sale and that merely mentioning that the seller was HUD is not evidence that the sale was not a market sale. Id.\ p 6.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Tribunal denies the Motion for Reconsideration}

Tribunal Judge David B. Marmon, instead of Judge Abood, denied Motion for Reconsideration. He did not specifically rebut Appellant's points made in the motion. Instead he clarified why the Tribunal was not applying \mathieuGast. The \reconsiderationDenied[2] contains the Tribunal's reasoning. In summary:

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item The Tribunal did not determine the before-repair value because:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the text of the statute does not plainly require a before-repair appraisal;
  \item the situations in the second sentence of MCL 211.27(2) are not at issue;
  \item the STC guidance requires appraisal if the value of the repairs are on the assessment roll, and here they are not;
  \item STC guidance lacks the force of law; and
  \item Petitioner has the burden of proof and the Tribunal disagrees with Petitioner's evidence (the sale price is given no weight or credibility).
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item The Tribunal gave the property's sale price ``no weight or credibility'' because the seller was a government entity (HUD) who may not have been motivated to receive market value.
  
\item The Tribunal did not give nonconsideration treatment to the normal repairs because the assessment did not consider the repairs. The property's true cash value assessment was \$48,000 in the year before the repairs and \$50,400 after the repairs. The 5\% change was due to inflation not repairs. Also, the pictures on the MLS showed the property in average condition.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{quotation}
The assessor shall not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs, replacement, and maintenance in determining the true cash value of property for assessment purposes until the property is sold.

For the purpose of implementing this subsection, the assessor shall not increase the construction quality classification or reduce the effective age for depreciation purposes, except if the appraisal of the property was erroneous before nonconsideration of the normal repair, replacement, or maintenance, and shall not assign an economic condition factor to the property that differs from the economic condition factor assigned to similar properties as defined by appraisal procedures applied in the jurisdiction.

The increase in value attributable to the items included in subdivisions (a) to (o) that is known to the assessor and excluded from true cash value shall be indicated on the assessment roll.

This subsection applies only to residential property.

\section{Argument}

\subsection{This Court creates an unsupported exception to Mathieu Gast}

This Court holds that Mathieu Gast does not apply if a home purchaser makes normal repairs in the year of the purchase.

\begin{quote}
Initially, we agree with the Tax Tribunal that because there was a transfer of ownership of the
subject property in 2015, MCL 211.27(2) did not prohibit the assessor from considering the impact
of any ``normal repairs'' on the property's TCV for purposes of the 2016 tax year.
\end{quote}
Opinion at 3. This interpretation of the law is contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of the law, the STC's interpretation, and the tax act as a whole.

\subsubsection{This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast violates its plain meaning}

This Court would disregard the meaning of the words of the statute, specifically the word ``until.'' 
The Mathieu Gast statute, MCL 211.27(2), begins like this:

\begin{quote}
  The assessor shall not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs . . . in determining the true cash value of property for assessment purposes \emph{until} the property is sold. [Emphasis added.]
\end{quote}

The word ``until'' makes clear that the sale which allows the consideration of the normal repairs must happen after the repairs are made. This Court's interpretation of the statute allows consideration of normal repairs because of a sale completed before the repairs. This violates the plain meaning of the statute.


% The word ``until'' makes clear that
% the consideration of normal repairs is tied to ownership. A repair is performed at a certain point in time. It is not to be considered by the assessor \emph{until} the property is sold. Before the property is sold, the repair cannot be considered. After the property is sold, the repair may, in fact must, be considered.


%This Court reads the word ``until'' as ``unless.'' See the opinion at 3:


%In contrast to this Court's alternative formulation, the actual statute makes clear that the consideration of normal repairs is tied to ownership. A repair is performed at a certain point in time. It is not to be considered by the assessor \emph{until} the property is sold. Before the property is sold, the repair cannot be considered. After the property is sold, the repair may, in fact must, be considered.

In a situation like the one in this case, where a purchaser makes repairs after the purchase but in the same year, application of Mathieu Gast is straightforward: the true cash value on December 31 of the year of purchase needs to:

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item include (consider) all the normal repairs that were done by the previous owner before the property sold, and 

\item  not include (not consider) all the normal repairs that were done after the property was sold, because those repairs were done by an owner who had not sold the property yet.
\end{enumerate}

% Thus at the end of the year in which a property sells, on tax day December 31, when the assessor is tasked with determining the true cash value of the property, the assessor must consider all the normal repairs that were done by the previous owner before the property sold. And the assessor must not consider all the normal repairs that were done after the property was sold, because those repairs were done by an owner who had not sold the property yet.

\subsubsection{This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast violates the statute's intent}

Mathieu Gast clearly gives a tax benefit to owners who perform normal repairs. The benefit lasts until the property is sold. This Court's interpretation reads this statute that encourages normal repairs as silently excluding from its benefits only those diligent homeowners who made repairs in the year they purchased their properties.

\subsubsection{This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast is not supported by the STC}

This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast is also not supported by the State Tax Commission, contrary to this Court's assertion. On page 6 of its opinion, this Court cites \pincite{STC Bulletin}{3}:

\begin{quote}
The exemption for normal repairs, replacements and maintenance ends in the year after the
owner who made the repairs, replacements and maintenance sells the property. \emph{In the year
following a sale, the assessed value shall be based on the true cash value of the entire property.}
The amount of assessment increase attributable to the value of formerly exempt property
returning to the assessment roll is new for equalization purposes. [Emphasis added by this Court.]
\end{quote}

This Court reads the emphasized sentence out of its context. The whole paragraph discusses when the exemption for normal repairs ends. The answer is given in the first sentence: the exemption ends ``in the year after \emph{the owner who made the repairs} . . . sells the property.'' The second sentence of this paragraph merely explains that after the repairer sells the property, the value of the previously exempt repairs is included in the assessed value. The second sentence does not create a major exception to the statute in the middle of an unrelated paragraph. There is no elephant in a mouse hole here.

\subsubsection{This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast is unsupported by the rest of the tax act}

This Court relies heavily on \cite{MCL 211.27a}, which discusses uncapping, and \cite{MCL 211.2(2)}, which defines tax day as December 31 of the previous year, to support its position that:

\begin{quote}
  [Mathieu Gast nonconsideration] cannot apply to repairs made
during a year in which there was a transfer of ownership because the property's taxable value for
the calendar year following the year of the transfer is the property's state equalized valuation for
the calendar year following the transfer, MCL 211.27a(3), which in turn is determined as of each
December 31 of the immediately preceding year, MCL 211.2(2). 
Thus, the tribunal correctly
held that it was required to determine the TCV of the subject property on the basis of its fair market 
%-5-
value as of December 31, 2015, \emph{regardless of any ``normal repairs'' made by petitioner in 2015
after he purchased the property.} [Cleaned up. Emphasis added.]
\end{quote}

Opinion at 4-5. It is true that a property's taxable value in the year after a transfer is based on its true cash value as of tax day, December 31 of the year of the transfer. The question is, what is the true cash value?

True cash value is defined in MCL 211.27. 
% \cite{MCL 211.27(1)} says that ```true cash value' is the usual selling price at the place where the property to which the term is applied is at the time of assessment . . .''
% \cite{MCL 211.27(2)}, Mathieu Gast, says: ``The assessor shall not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs . . .''
% \cite{MCL 211.27(3)}\ says that amounts paid for obtaining financing, personal property, and surveying must be excluded from sales data used to determine assessments.
There are eight subsections in \cite{MCL 211.27}. All of them relate to the determination of ``true cash value'' and none of them, including the second, Mathieu Gast, are in any way annulled by \cite{MCL 211.27a(2)}\ which simply says that in the year following a transfer the taxable value is the state equalized value.

This Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast essentially creates a bespoke definition of ``true cash value'' only for MCL 211.27a(3). This is inconsistent with the idea of reading the tax act as a whole. 

%   \begin{quote}
%   Because petitioner purchased the subject property in August 2015, the taxable value of the
% property became uncapped between August 2015 and December 31, 2015, and, for the 2016 tax
% year, the assessor was required to determine the property's TCV as of December 31, 2015.
% Petitioner argues that under MCL 211.27(2), respondent can consider the value added by ``normal
% repairs'' only when petitioner sells the property, because the statute states that ``[t]he assessor shall
% not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs,

% during a year in which there was a transfer of ownership because ``the property's taxable value for

% \end{quote}

% Opinion at 4-5. 

% This section defines:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The \emph{assessed value} in MCL 211.27(a)(1) as 50\% of the true cash value. The true cash value is defined in the in the previous section, MCL 211.27, as the ``usual selling price,'' \cite{MCL 211.27(1)}, exclusive of normal repairs, \cite{MCL 211.27(2)}.

% \item The \emph{taxable value} as a capped version of the equalized assessed value (state equalized value). MCL 211.27a(2)-(4). A property's taxable value is initially (in 1994) set to its state equalized value. Thereafter, as long as a property is not sold, its taxable value is the lesser of the current state equalized value or the previous year's taxable value adjusted by a capped inflation rate. This protects property owners from runaway tax bills in a rising market. When a property is transferred, the process resets: in the year following the transfer, the taxable value is set to the state equalized value, and thereafter capped until another transfer. This resetting of the taxable value to the state equalized value is called uncapping.
% \end{itemize}

% Where this Court goes wrong is that it reads into \cite{MCL 211.27a(3)}, the part of the statute discussing uncapping (although this term is not used in the statute), the idea that the uncapping creates an exception to the definition of true cash value in the previous section, MCL 211.27.

% Opinion at 4-5. It does not. MCL 211.27a refers to the ``state equalized value'' as both a ceiling for the capped taxable value in paragraph (2) and as the only value for the uncapped taxable value in paragraph (3). The state equalized value is the assessed value, defined in MCL 211.27a(1) as 50\% of the true cash value, that has been equalized.\footnote{See \pincite{Guide to Basic Assessing}{29-32}\ for information on how equalization works.}

% This Court's main error was that it incorporated into the Mathieu Gast statute, MCL 211.27(2), the exception that the statute does not apply in the year that the property is purchased. This exception is not in the statute itself, has no support in the rest of the Tax Act, is contrary to the State Tax Commission guidance and is irrational. Namely, this Court's interpretation of Mathieu Gast would reward all owners for normal repairs except the industrious purchaser of a rundown house who immediately repairs the property rather than waits to repair the property in the next calendar year.

% \subsubsection{Unsupported by statute}
% Nonconsideration and Capping are separate concepts in the Tax Act.
% They are addressed in different parts of the Act, have different purposes, and involve different procedures.

% Nonconsideration is designed to encourage homeowners to update and maintain their properties. Nonconsideration requires that the normal, market-based assessed value be reduced by the value added by normal repairs. The value added by normal repairs is tracked in the assessment roll and added back into the assessed value when the property is transferred to a new owner.

% Thus for example, if Sally Seller installs a new roof (this is a normal repair under Mathieu Gast) and thereby adds \$10,000 to the value of her home, this added value is subtracted or nonconsidered from the actual, after-repaired value of her home. Nonconsideration makes Sally's AV the same after normal repairs as before.

% When Sally sells to Bobby Buyer, the previously nonconsidered value of Sally's normal repairs are now considered. Bobby's AV is based on the full, non-adjusted market value of the home with the new roof. Mathieu Gast does not give Bobby the benefit of Sally's normal repairs. But, if Bobby makes his own normal repairs, then Mathieu Gast would protect him.

% Notice that nonconsideration is only concerned with how assessed values are calculated. Assessed values are determined every year and set at one half of the market value. Nonconsideration reduces the assessed value by the value contributed by normal repairs.

% On the other hand, capping is designed to shield homeowners from rapidly rising property taxes due to rapidly appreciating property values. Tax bills are calculated from the taxable value, TV, rather than the assessed value, AV, which follows the market value. The TV is capped because is guaranteed to grow no faster than the rate of inflation or 5\%, whichever is lower, even when the market value of the property (and the corresponding AV) is growing much faster. The TV is uncapped when the property is transferred. The uncapping means that the TV is set equal to the AV.

% Thus while new owners are protected from rapidly rising property taxes via capping, their starting point is the assessed value on December 31 of the year they, the new owners, bought the property, not the year that the sellers acquired the property. Each owner starts off paying their ``correct'' market-based property tax, and is thereafter protected from rapidly rising values.

% Notice that capping and uncapping do not affect assessed value. The assessed value is determined each year and should be one half of the true market value of the property. Capping and uncapping simply relate the taxable value to the assessed value.

% How do capping and nonconsideration interact? It is clear that capping is downstream of nonconsideration. That is, capping, which affects only the taxable value, does not affect nonconsideration, which is concerned with assessed value. 

% Suppose Sally Seller bought her house on tax day, December 31, 2000, for its then market value of \$50,000. Sally's AV and TV for 2001 are \$50,000. Sally's TV is capped, starting from 2001.

% Suppose further that by 2018 Sally's home has grown in value to \$100,000. (Her AV is half of that or \$50,000.) Sally adds a new roof in 2018 which adds \$10,000 to the value of her home. decides to sell her home

% \subsubsection{Irrational}
 \subsection{This Court misapplies the law of the case doctrine}

Besides misinterpreting Mathieu Gast, this Court has also misapplied the law of the case doctrine in two ways. First, it misapplied the doctrine in finding that this Court had left open the question in \cite{Patru 1}\ as to whether Mathieu Gast applies for repairs done by a purchaser in the year of purchase. This Court had not left open this question. Instead, this Court, and the Tribunal before it, had assumed that there was no such exception to Mathieu Gast. This point was not brought up in the first go-around.
Instead, this Court had remanded solely on the question of whether normal repairs had been performed. 
It was assumed by all, the Petitioner/Appellant, the Respondend/Appellee, the Tribunal, and this Court, that once normal repairs were found, that the assessed value would be set at the pre-repair value.

\begin{quotation}
  In its final opinion and judgment, the Tribunal recognized that the referee erred in its
interpretation of MCL 211.27(2); however, it nevertheless upheld the determination of TCV.
The Tribunal reasoned that because the spreadsheet detailing the repairs completed on the
property had not been submitted before the hearing, it had no obligation to consider that
evidence, so it concluded that Patru failed to establish that the repairs constituted normal repairs.
However, as stated above, Patru did present evidence at the hearing in support of his claim that
MCL 211.27(2) applied. The referee did not fully evaluate that evidence---which included
testimony---because it misapprehended how to properly apply MCL 211.27(2).
Further, because the hearing was not transcribed, we cannot determine whether the
evidence Patru provided at the hearing was reflective of the information on the spreadsheet
submitted with his exceptions. If the testimony provided was an oral recitation of the
information included on the spreadsheet, then Patru presented testimony sufficient to establish
that at least some of the repairs constituted normal repairs under MCL 211.27(2), and so the
increase in TCV attributed to those repairs should not be considered in the property's TCV for
assessment purposes until such time as Patru sells the property. However, if Patru merely
testified that he did some carpentry, electrical, and masonry repairs and no further explanation of
the work that was provided, then he would have arguably failed to support his claim. Either way,
on the record before this Court, we cannot evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence presented at
the hearing. Thus, we conclude that further proceedings are necessary in order to determine
whether the repairs were normal repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2). Accordingly, we
remand to the Tax Tribunal for a rehearing. Further, because the existing record is insufficient to
resolve whether the repairs are normal repairs within the meaning of the statute, the parties shall
be afforded further opportunity to submit additional proofs. See Fisher v Sunfield Township, 163

TCV. However, as the Tribunal must make its own, independent determination of TCV, Great
Lakes Div of Nat'l Steel Corp v City of Ecorse, 227 Mich App 379, 389; 576 NW2d 667 (1998),
we conclude that Patru's failure to persuade the Tribunal that the property's purchase price
reflected the pre-repair TCV is irrelevant. The Tribunal independently had to evaluate all the
evidence presented and, properly applying MCL 211.27(2), arrive at the property's TCV.)
\end{quotation}

Secondly, this Court failed to apply the law of the case doctrine in upholding the Tribunal's second ruling which was based on the second Tribunal's opinion that the subject property was is average condition at the time of purchase. The first Tribunal found the opposite, and indeed based its decision in part on the fact that the repairs were not normal because the  property's condition was too poor.

\begin{quote}
Thus, the referee determined that if a property is purchased in substandard condition, any repairs
done on the property to bring it into good repair do not constitute normal repairs, maintenance, or
replacement within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2), so the increase in TCV resulting from those
repairs can be immediately considered in determining the TCV for assessment purposes. The
referee then determined that the TCV for the property was \$50,400.
\end{quote}

In this case both the law and the facts were changed by the Tribunal in the 2nd go-around, contrary to the law of the case.

\hrule 


This case is not governed by \cite[s]{Patru 1}\ because ``this Court did not resolve whether petitioner's 2015 repairs to the property could or could not be considered in determining the property's TCV for the 2016 tax year, but instead
determined that ``further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the repairs were normal
repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2).'' . . . More significantly, this Court
did not address the effect of the property's transfer of ownership in 2015 on the tribunal's
consideration of ``normal repairs'' under MCL 211.27(2) for purposes of the 2016 tax year.
Because this issue was not actually addressed and decided in the prior appeal, the law-of-the-case
doctrine does not apply.'' \pincite{Patru 2}{5}.

\begin{quotation}
  Further, because the hearing was not transcribed, we cannot determine whether the
evidence Patru provided at the hearing was reflective of the information on the spreadsheet

\subsection{This Court allows the Tribunal to improperly assume facts}

This Court also erred when it endorsed the idea that Tribunal could use the previous year's uncontested assessed TCV to override the actual evidence presented in the case as to the subject property's pre-repair TCV.

\begin{quote}
  It is undisputed that the assessed
TCV of the property for the 2015 tax year was \$48,000. Given this evidence, it was appropriate
for the tribunal to draw conclusions about the value of the property before and after petitioner's
purchase, specifically, that the prior year's assessment of \$48,000 was reflective of the property's
TCV before petitioner purchased it, that an increase of \$2,400 could be attributed to inflation and 
-6-
increases in the market, and that petitioner's ``normal repairs'' were not attributable to the
property's substandard condition, but rather were intended primarily to prepare the property as
rental property.
\end{quote}

\pincite{Patru 2}{5-6}.

The previous year's assessed value was not at issue, the time for its appeal having passed before Petitioner/Appellant had purchased the property.\footnote{If the previous year's assessed TCV is presumed to be the actual TCV of the property on the previous tax day, tax appeals could be settled simply by looking at property appreciation. But \cite{Jones & Laughlin}\ teaches that the Tax Tribunal must independently determine the TCV at issue using primary evidence, sales studies and replacement cost estimates.} At issue was the pre-repair value of the property which under \cite{Jones & Laughlin}\ requires the Tribunal to make an independent  determination. The Tribunal cannot assume that City's previous-year's assessed TCV was correct.


\begin{quotation}
   It is undisputed that the assessed
TCV of the property for the 2015 tax year was \$48,000. Given this evidence, it was appropriate

a property in average condition both at the time Petitioner acquired it and after he completed the
normal repairs,'' and that ``the assessment did not consider the increase in true cash value that was
the result of normal repairs.''

The same error is present when this Court endorses the Tribunal's substitution of opinion for fact regarding the seller's motivation.
