  % (b) All real property owned by this state or purchased or condemned for public highway purposes by any board, officer, commission, or department of this state and sold on land contract, notwithstanding the fact that the deed has not been executed transferring title.
  % (c) For taxes levied after December 31, 2002, buildings and improvements located upon leased real property, except buildings and improvements exempt under section 9f or improvements assessable under section 8(h), if the value of the buildings or improvements is not otherwise included in the assessment of the real property. However, buildings and improvements located on leased real property shall not be treated as real property unless they would be treated as real property if they were located on real property owned by the taxpayer.
  % (2) The taxable status of persons and real and personal property for a tax year shall be determined as of each December 31 of the immediately preceding year, which is considered the tax day, any provisions in the charter of any city or village to the contrary notwithstanding. An assessing officer is not restricted to any particular period in the preparation of the assessment roll but may survey, examine, or review property at any time before or after the tax day.

%   (2) The assessor shall not consider the increase in true cash value that is a result of expenditures for normal repairs, replacement, and maintenance in determining the true cash value of property for assessment purposes until the property is sold. For the purpose of implementing this subsection, the assessor shall not increase the construction quality classification or reduce the effective age for depreciation purposes, except if the appraisal of the property was erroneous before nonconsideration of the normal repair, replacement, or maintenance, and shall not assign an economic condition factor to the property that differs from the economic condition factor assigned to similar properties as defined by appraisal procedures applied in the jurisdiction. The increase in value attributable to the items included in subdivisions (a) to (o) that is known to the assessor and excluded from true cash value shall be indicated on the assessment roll. This subsection applies only to residential property. The following repairs are considered normal maintenance if they are not part of a structural addition or completion:
% (a) Outside painting.
% (b) Repairing or replacing siding, roof, porches, steps, sidewalks, or drives.
% (c) Repainting, repairing, or replacing existing masonry.
% (d) Replacing awnings.
% (e) Adding or replacing gutters and downspouts.
% (f) Replacing storm windows or doors.
% (g) Insulating or weatherstripping.
% (h) Complete rewiring.
% (i) Replacing plumbing and light fixtures.
% (j) Replacing a furnace with a new furnace of the same type or replacing an oil or gas burner.
% (k) Repairing plaster, inside painting, or other redecorating.
% (l) New ceiling, wall, or floor surfacing.
% (m) Removing partitions to enlarge rooms.
% (n) Replacing an automatic hot water heater.

In determining the true cash value of transferred property, an assessing officer shall assess that property using the same valuation method used to value all other property of that same classification in the assessing jurisdiction. As used in this subsection and subsection (7), "purchase price" means the total consideration agreed to in an arms-length transaction and not at a forced sale paid by the purchaser of the property, stated in dollars, whether or not paid in dollars.

\section{Facts}
\label{facts}

Before it was bought by Appellant, the subject house was owned by HUD.
% (U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development).
\mlsListing[]. 
The house had been listed on the MLS on and off since April 2013;
it's initial asking price was \$29,900,
but by the time Appellant bought the house, the asking price was \$32,000,
which was the price Appellant paid in August 2015. \mlsHistory[].

The City of Wayne (Appellee/Respondent) required repairs before it it granted Appellant a certificate of occupancy. %, it required repairs.
\repairs. ``It is undisputed that, when he purchased the property, it was in substandard condition and required numerous repairs to make it livable. Patru completed the required repairs on the property as of December 31, 2015.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{1}.

\subsection{First Appeal}

Appellee assessed the subject property for 2016 at a true cash value of \$50,400. Appellant appealed, arguing that the assessment was the after-repair value as of December 31, 2015.
Appellant contended that the repairs were normal repairs under \mathieuGast\ and that the house must be valued at its before-repair value. 
``Petitioner claims that under \mathieuGast\ we should not increase the subject's true cash value for normal repairs and maintenance until the subject is sold.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{2}\ (quoting the tribunal's POJ in the first appeal).

The Tax Tribunal referee ruled that \mathieuGast\ nonconsideration did not apply because the property was in substandard condition.
This Court reversed:

\begin{quote}
  The hearing referee incorrectly interpreted \mathieuGast\ by concluding that because repairs were done to a property in substandard condition, they did not constitute normal repairs. . . . This was improper . . . Nothing in \mathieuGast\ provides that the repairs . . . are not normal repairs in the event that they are performed on a substandard property. Thus by reading a requirement into the statute that was not stated by the legislature, the trial erred . . . See \pincite{Mich Ed}{218}\ (stating that nothing will be read into a clear statute that is not within the manifest intention of the Legislature as derived from the language of the statute itself).
\end{quote}
\pincite{Patru 1}{5}.

This court could not fully resolve the case because the tax tribunal had not ruled that the repairs met the specific criteria of \mathieuGast.
The referee had misunderstood the statute and so had not determined whether Appellant's testimony about the repairs fell under the statute. 
Petitioner had submitted a spreadsheet which did list the repairs and their specific \mathieuGast\ criteria, but the tribunal had refused to consider it because it was submitted after the hearing.
So this Court remanded the case back to the tribunal. \pincite{Patru 1}{5-6}.

% \begin{quote}
%   \label{firstHolding}
% If the testimony provided was an oral recitation of the
% information included on the spreadsheet, then Patru presented testimony sufficient to establish
% that at least some of the repairs constituted normal repairs under MCL 211.27(2), and so the
% increase in TCV attributed to those repairs should not be considered in the property's TCV for
% assessment purposes until such time as Patru sells the property. However, if Patru merely
% testified that he did some carpentry, electrical, and masonry repairs and no further explanation of
% the work that was provided, then he would have arguably failed to support his claim. Either way,
% on the record before this Court, we cannot evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence presented at
% the hearing. Thus, we conclude that further proceedings are necessary in order to determine
% whether the repairs were normal repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2). Accordingly, we
% remand to the Tax Tribunal for a rehearing. Further, because the existing record is insufficient to
% resolve whether the repairs are normal repairs within the meaning of the statute, the parties shall
% be afforded further opportunity to submit additional proofs. See \pincite{Fisher}{743}
% (requiring rehearing when it was not clear whether the
% proofs submitted were sufficient to establish that repair expenditures were normal repairs).
% \end{quote}
%\pincite{Patru 1}{5-6}.

\subsection{Second Appeal}

On remand, the tribunal ruled that the repairs were normal, but it again found a reason not to apply \mathieuGast\ nonconsideration. The tribunal ruled that  \mathieuGast\ did not apply for repairs done in a year of a transfer, even if the repairs were done by the new owner.
This Court has now affirmed this interpretation.

Also, contrary to previously undisputed finding, the tribunal ruled that the property's before-repair condition was not substandard, but rather that the repairs ``did not affect the assessed [true cash value] of the property . . ..'' Opinion at 1. This Court has now affirmed this finding also.


\section{Standard of Review}

MCL 2.119(F)(3) says:

\begin{quote}
  Generally, and without restricting the discretion of the court, a motion for rehearing or reconsideration which merely presents the same issues ruled on by the court, either expressly or by reasonable implication, will not be granted. The moving party must demonstrate a palpable error by which the court and the parties have been misled and show that a different disposition of the motion must result from correction of the error.
\end{quote}

 A palpable error is a clear error ``easily perceptible, plain, obvious, readily
 visible, noticeable, patent, distinct, manifest.'' \pincite{Luckow}{426; 453}\ (cleaned up).
 
% ``The palpable error provision in MCL 2.119(F)(3)  is not mandatory and only provides guidance to a court about when it may be appropriate to consider a motion for rehearing or reconsideration.'' \pincite{Walters}{350; 430}.

``The rule [MCL 2.119(F)(3)] does not categorically prevent a trial court from revisiting an issue even when the motion for reconsideration presents the same issue already ruled upon; in fact, it allows considerable discretion to correct mistakes.'' \pincite{Macomb County Department of Human Services}{754}. 

\section{Argument}



% Appellant asks that this Court reconsider this opinion, because this Court's answer to the first question contradicts the law of the case and also contradicts both the plain language of the statute and the tax act's overall scheme.

\subsection{The exception to \mathieuGast\ is not supported}

This court reviews the Tax Tribunal's statutory interpretation de novo. \pincite{Briggs}{75}.

This Court previously faulted the Tax Tribunal for violating the rule that ``nothing will be read into a clear statute that is not within the manifest intention of the Legislature as derived from the language of the statute itself.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}, quoting \pincite{Mich Ed}{218}. By reading into \mathieuGast\ an exception for repairs done in the year of a transfer but after the sale, this Court now makes the same error.

% The statute specifies that repairs should not considered ``\emph{until} the property is sold.'' This clearly indicates that nonconsideration ends only if there is a sale after the repairs. Here there was no sale after Appellant's repairs. Instead this Court would use a sale before the repairs to end the nonconsideration period. This violates the plain words of the statute.

The statute requires nonconsideration ``\emph{until} the property is sold.'' The word until means that there must be a sale after the repairs for nonconsideration to end. This Court's refusal to apply nonconsideration where there is no sale after the repairs is a violation of the plain words of the statute.

This Court's interpretation also perverts the intent of the statute which is to promote repairs.
This Court would require that purchasers delay repairs until the year after the sale, to establish the unrepaired value as of December 31.
Diligent buyers who start repairs too early
% cannot rely on the plain text of statute, but
are exempted from nonconsideration not by the plain language of the statute itself but via the complex interplay of at least two other statutes in the tax act.
It seems odd that this was the legislature's intent.

% 
% By reading into the statute an unwritten exclusion for repairs in the year of purchase,
% this Court transforms Mathieu Gast
% from a pure incentive for homeowners to make repairs
% into a trap which punishes diligent purchasers who,
% relying on the plain words of the statute,
% repair right away. % rather than waiting until the year after purchase.
% Under this Court's interpretation, purchasers who wish to benefit from nonconsideration must delay repairs until the year after the sale, to establish the unrepaired value as of December 31.

%There is no evidence that in a situation like this, the legislature intended to incentivize the Appellant to delay repairs to establish the unrepaired value at the end of the transfer year, and then make the normal repairs in the following year. 

This Court's analysis of the issue is correct up to the proposition 
that the uncapped taxable value is based on the true cash value of the property in the year after the transfer.\footnote{The uncapped taxable value is the equalized assessed value (state equalized value). \cite{MCL 211.27a(3)}. The assessed value is one half of the true cash value. \cite{MCL 211.27a(1)}. The true cash value is always calculated as of tax day. ```true cash value' means the usual selling price . . . at the time of assessment,'' \cite{MCL 211.27(1)}. ``The taxable status of . . . real . . . property for a tax year shall be determined as of each December 31 of the immediately preceding year, which is considered the tax day,'' \cite{MCL 211.2(2)}.}
But this Court errs when it equates true cash value with fair market value ``regardless of any ``normal repairs'' made by petitioner in [the year of purchase].'' Opinion at 5.

True cash value is defined and refined in \cite{MCL 211.27}%
\footnote{Internally \cite[s]{MCL 211.27}\ may define true cash value in terms of itself. For example, \mathieuGast\ uses ``true cash value for assessment purposes'' to distinguish from the ``true cash value'' that increased due to normal repairs. But outside of \cite[s]{MCL 211.27}, in the rest of the tax act, there is only one ``true cash value'' which incorporates all of \cite[s]{MCL 211.27}.
  For example, assessed value is defined in \cite{MCL 211.27a(1)}\ as 50\% of the true cash value. Obviously with respect to \mathieuGast\ this means the ``true cash value for assessment purposes.'' But, as it is outside of \cite[s]{MCL 211.27}, \cite{MCL 211.27a(1)}\ uses the term ``true cash value.''}, 
which has eight subsections, which if reproduced here would span five pages. Courts have summarized true cash value as ``fair market value,'' based on the term ``usual selling price'' in subsection 1. But this shorthand is used only in cases where a more complex definition is not needed. There is no case, except this Court's opinion here, that holds that the caselaw-derived term ``fair market value'' overrides or invalidates an applicable subsection of \cite[s]{MCL 211.27}.
% which holds that   defines true cash value as the ``usual selling price'' which is a good working definition for many cases. 
% in this brief. spanning several pages. which would span several pages if reproduced here. All of these subsections refine the meaning of true cash value. Subsection 1 uses the term ``usual selling price'' which caselaw says means fair market value.%
% \footnote{This Court's opinion at 4 cites \pincite{Pontiac Country Club}{434-435}\ for the proposition that ``TCV is synonymous with fair market value.'' There are many such cases because most cases do not require a more specific definition of true cash value. This Court has not cited any case which teaches that a relevant subsection of \cite{MCL 211.27}\ should be ignored in favor of the simple definition that true cash value is fair market value.}
% This is a good general definition but cannot always replace every aspect of a multiple page statute.
% In this case, subsection 2 adds a relevant refinement to the general definition.
% % Here this Court should consider subsection 2 which specifies that the value due to normal repairs is not part of true cash value until the property is sold.
For this case, true cash value should mean ``the usual selling price . . . at the time of assessment,'' \cite{MCL 211.27(1)}, but not considering the value added by normal repairs, \mathieuGast.

% \footnote{\cite{\mathieuGast\ uses the term, ``true cash value for assessment purposes'' to distinguish from the ``true cash value'' of \cite{MCL 211.27(1)}\ which presumably may include the value of normal repairs and is thus not always suitable for assessment purposes. But read as a whole \cite{MCL 211.27}\ as a whole as defining ``true cash value for assessment purposes'' or just ``true cash value'' for short. Obviously the assessed value of \cite{MCL 211.27a(1)}\ uses this ``true cash value for assessment purposes'' because it is for assessment purposes.}

Furthermore, \mathieuGast, as part of the definition of true cash value, is not dependent on the capped or uncapped status of the taxable value defined in the next section, \cite{MCL 211.27a}. Rather the effect goes the other way. \mathieuGast\ always
operates to exclude from the true cash value the value of normal repairs no matter if it is used to establish the assessed value of \cite{MCL 211.27a(1)}\ or value of additions of \cite{MCL 211.27a(2)(b)}.

Contrary to this Court's assertion, its interpretation of Mathieu Gast is not supported by the State Tax Commission. On page 6 of its opinion, this Court cites, with its own emphasis, \pincite{STC Bulletin}{3}:

\begin{quote}
The exemption for normal repairs, replacements and maintenance ends in the year after the
owner who made the repairs, replacements and maintenance sells the property. \emph{In the year
following a sale, the assessed value shall be based on the true cash value of the entire property.}
The amount of assessment increase attributable to the value of formerly exempt property
returning to the assessment roll is new for equalization purposes.
\end{quote}

This Court reads the just the second, emphasized, sentence out of its context. The first sentence of paragraph gives the topic: ``The exemption . . . ends in the year after \emph{the owner who made the repairs} . . . sells the property.'' In this context, the second sentence's ``entire property'' means the property with the seller's repairs considered. The buyer's repairs are not in the paragraph's scope.\footnote{This Court used this out-of-context quote to justify its holding that before-repair and after-repairs appraisals were not required. Opinion at 6. As this passage does not say what this Court thinks it says, the Court's holding on this point is without support.}
%The second sentence does not create a major exception to the statute in the middle of an unrelated paragraph. There is no elephant in a mouse hole here.


\subsection{The ruling that the repairs did not affect the true cash value is not supported}

This Court accepts the Tax Tribunal's factual findings if they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. \pincite{Briggs}{75}.

Besides ruling that \mathieuGast\ did not apply, % because of uncapping,
the tribunal also ruled that the repairs did not affect the property's true cash value. But this is not supported by the record as a whole.

The opinion says: ``The
tribunal did not credit petitioner's argument that the property was in substandard condition when
he purchased it.'' Opinion at 5. This is not quite a fair characterization; the property's substandard condition is not merely Appellant's argument. Throughout the first trip to this Court until the tribunal's last Final Opinion, all the actors in this case, the parties, the tribunal and this Court relied on the well-established fact that the subject property was in substandard condition before the repairs. This case was first appealed to this Court because ``[t]he hearing referee incorrectly interpreted \mathieuGast\ by concluding that because the repairs were done to a property in substandard condition, they did not constitute normal repairs.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. 
``It is undisputed that, when he purchased the property, it was in substandard condition and required numerous repairs to make it livable.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{1}.
% At the second hearing before the tribunal, neither Appellant/Petitioner nor Appellee/Respondent presented evidence or took the position that the house was not in substandard condition before repairs.
The tribunal's reversal of a fact which was foundational to its first ruling was not based on new evidence: neither party ever argued that the house was not in substandard condition before repairs. Therefore this Court should take a careful look at the tribunal's reasoning for this drastic reinterpretation of the evidence.


% This Court in this opinion starts off the discussion of this issue by saying: ``The
% tribunal did not credit petitioner's argument that the property was in substandard condition when
% he purchased it.'' Opinion at 5. But the property's substandard condition is not merely Appellant's argument. Throughout the first trip to this Court until the tribunal's last Final Opinion, all the actors in this case, the Appellant/Petitioner, the Appellee/Respondent, the tribunal, and this Court assumed and were relying on the fact that the subject property was in substandard condition before the repairs. Indeed, the reason this case was first appealed to this Court was because ``The hearing referee incorrectly interpreted \mathieuGast\ by concluding that because the repairs were done to a property in substandard condition, they did not constitute normal repairs.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. 
% ``It is undisputed that, when he purchased the property, it was in substandard condition and required numerous repairs to make it livable.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{1}. At the second hearing before the tribunal, neither Appellant/Petitioner nor Appellee/Respondent presented evidence or took the position that the house was not in substandard condition before repairs. The tribunal's reversal of a fact which was foundational to its first ruling was not based on new evidence. Therefore this Court should take a careful look at the tribunal's reasoning that prompted it to so drastically reinterpret the evidence.

The tribunal relied on pictures and the prior year's assessed value:

\begin{quote}
The tribunal found that
petitioner's MLS listing for the subject property showed a property in ``average'' condition, and
that petitioner's photographs of the property, before any repairs, showed ``a property that is livable
and habitable with reasonable marketability and appeal.'' . . .
%The tribunal noted that the purpose of petitioner's repairs was ``to ready the property as a tenant rental.''
It is undisputed that the assessed
TCV of the property for the 2015 tax year was \$48,000.
\end{quote}
Opinion at 5.
The fact that the photographs show the house as livable and habitable should be considered in light of the city's different opinion. The city had inspected the whole house, not just the parts shown in the marketing pictures, before it sold and refused to issue a certificate of occupancy until repairs were made; ``the city required that the repairs be made.'' \pincite{Patru 1}{2}, quoting the tribunal's first Proposed Opinion. The spreadsheet listing the repairs  shows that most of the repairs performed were required by the city. See \repairs[]. The fact that the realtor who put the pictures in the MLS had listed the property at \$29,900 and then at \$32,000, well below the market value of a repaired house, and that it took more than two years to sell, also raises doubts that the repairs did not add value.

Regarding the prior year's assessed value, Appellee/Respondent testified at the hearing that ``mass appraisal does not account for properties one-by-one. In other words, properties are assessed uniformly and \emph{Respondent assumes properties are in ``average'' condition.}'' \foj[4], emphasis added. So the assessed value cannot be evidence of a property's before-repair value, because the assessed value is just the output of a mass appraisal computer program that assumes average condition.

\subsection{The law of the case requires reversal}

\begin{quote}
  Under the doctrine of the law of the case, if an appellate court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case for further proceedings, the legal question will not be differently determined in a subsequent appeal in the same case were the facts remain materially the same. The primary purpose of the law-of-the-case doctrine is to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single  % 500*500
  continuing lawsuit. . . .  [T]he doctrine is discretionary, rather than mandatory.
\end{quote}
\pincite{Bennett}{499-500}.

This Court in this opinion at 5 cites two reasons why this case is not governed by the law of the case. First,
this Court had not resolved whether ``the repairs were normal repairs within the meaning of \mathieuGast.'' This was not resolved because the existing record was insufficient. \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. This Court had ruled, however, that if the Tribunal found that the repairs listed on the spreadsheet had been performed, these would constitute normal repairs and should not be considered as part of the true cash value:

\begin{quote}
  If the testimony provided was an oral recitation of the
information included on the spreadsheet, then Patru presented testimony sufficient to establish
that at least some of the repairs constituted normal repairs under MCL 211.27(2), and so the
increase in TCV attributed to those repairs should not be considered in the property's TCV for
assessment purposes until such time as Patru sells the property.
\end{quote}
\pincite{Patru 1}{5}. So on remand, the tribunal should have applied nonconsideration after it found that the repairs as listed on the spreadsheet were normal repairs.



% \begin{enumerate}
% \item This Court had not resolved whether ``the repairs were normal repairs within the meaning of \mathieuGast.'' 
% \item This Court had not addressed the effect of the property's transfer of ownership.
% \end{enumerate}

% Regarding the first reason, the reason why this Court had not resolved whether the repairs were normal repairs was that the tribunal had not made a fact finding about the particular repairs performed. The referee had not understood the statute and so did not ``fully evaluate the evidence---which included testimony,'' \pincite{Patru 1}{5}, and the Tribunal Judge had refused to admit and consider the spreadsheet listing the repairs. \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. This Court ruled, however, that if the Tribunal found that the repairs listed on the spreadsheet had been performed, these would constitute normal repairs and should not be considered as part of the true cash value:

% \begin{quote}
%   If the testimony provided was an oral recitation of the
% information included on the spreadsheet, then Patru presented testimony sufficient to establish
% that at least some of the repairs constituted normal repairs under MCL 211.27(2), and so the
% increase in TCV attributed to those repairs should not be considered in the property's TCV for
% assessment purposes until such time as Patru sells the property.
% \end{quote}
% \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. So on remand, the tribunal should have applied nonconsideration after it found that the repairs as listed on the spreadsheet were normal repairs.

Instead, despite finding that the repairs were normal, the tribunal did not apply nonconsideration because of the second reason: it thought that the transfer of ownership and uncapping created an exception. Opinion at 5. The teaching of \cite[s]{Bennett}\ is helpful here.

In \cite[s]{Bennett},
the lower court had denied defendant's motion to terminate his child support early.
While the case was on appeal, a law was enacted which supported the lower court's decision.
The law took effect before the appeals court called the case.
The appeals court reversed the lower court, but did not mention the new law.
On remand, plaintiff asked the lower court to deny defendant's motion a second time,
based on the new law which the appeals court had not addressed.
The lower court refused because of the law of the case. Plaintiff appealed.

The appeals court affirmed, reasoning that even though it thought that its first decision was wrong, by substituting its judgment for the prior appeals court panel, it would be doing ``the very activity the law-of-the-case doctrine is designed to discourage.'' \pincite{Bennett}{501}. If the prior panel was not aware of the new law, the parties were at fault because ``ultimately it is the responsibility of the parties to bring to this Court's attention that case law and those statutes that the parties wish the Court to consider in deciding the matter.'' \pincite{Bennett}{501}.

Thus \cite[s]{Bennett}\ teaches that the law of the case precludes even correct arguments that could have been brought up in the first appeal. So even if this Court agrees with the tribunal's latest decision,
%that \mathieuGast\ does not cover this case,
it should still reverse and affirm its earlier ruling. As in Bennett, Appellee could have made its arguments (that \mathieuGast\ does not apply if the repairs are made in the year of a transfer and that the property was in average condition before the repairs) before this Court on the first appeal.



% \cite[s]{Patru 1}\ because

% \begin{quote}
%   this Court did not resolve whether petitioner's 2015 repairs to the property could or could not be considered in determining the property's TCV for the 2016 tax year, but instead
% determined that ``further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the repairs were normal
% repairs within the meaning of MCL 211.27(2).'' . . . More significantly, this Court
% did not address the effect of the property's transfer of ownership in 2015 on the tribunal's
% consideration of ``normal repairs'' under MCL 211.27(2) for purposes of the 2016 tax year.
% Because this issue was not actually addressed and decided in the prior appeal, the law-of-the-case
% doctrine does not apply.

% \end{quote}
% \pincite{Patru 1}{5}. On remand, this Court expected the tribunal to determine which of the repairs fit the criteria of \mathieuGast, and then apply nonconsideration to those repairs, using before-repair and after-repair appraisals.

% based on the new law which the appeals court had not addressed.
% The lower court refused because of the law of the case. Plaintiff appealed.

% The appeals court affirmed, reasoning that even though it thought that its first decision was wrong, by substituting its judgment for the prior appeals court panel, it would be doing ``the very activity the law-of-the-case doctrine is designed to discourage.'' \pincite{Bennett}{501}. If the prior panel was not aware of the new law, the parties were at fault because ``ultimately it is the responsibility of the parties to bring to this Court's attention that case law and those statutes that the parties wish the Court to consider in deciding the matter.'' \pincite{Bennett}{501}.

% Thus even if this Court agrees with the tribunal's latest decision,
% %that \mathieuGast\ does not cover this case,
% it should still reverse and affirm its earlier ruling. As in Bennett, Appellee could have made its arguments (that \mathieuGast\ does not apply if the repairs are made in the year of a transfer and that the property was in average condition before the repairs) before this Court on the first appeal.

\subsection{This Court wrongly affirms the tribunal's rejection of the purchase price}

When reviewing Tax Tribunal cases, this Court looks for misapplication of the law or adoption of a wrong principle. Factual findings must be supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo. \pincite{Briggs}{75; 757-758}.
%The Tribunal's factual findings are accepted as final by this Court ``provided they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. Substantial evidence must be more than a scintilla of evidence, although it may be substantially less than a preponderance of the evidence.'' \pincite[s]{Jones & Laughlin}{352-53}\ (cleaned up).

% Regarding the tribunal's rejection of the sale price, Appellant is not complaining that ``the tribunal erred by rejecting his 2015 purchase price of the
% property as determinative of its TCV.'' Opinion at 6. Rather, Appellant's brief at 18-19 complains that the tribunal gave the sale price ``no weight or credibility,'' \reconsiderationDenied[2], contrary to the clear teaching of \pincite[s]{Jones & Laughlin}{353-354}: ``the price at which an item of
% property actually sold is most certainly relevant evidence'' and ``the tribunal's opinion that the evidence ``has little or no
% bearing'' on the property's earlier value suggests that the evidence was rejected out of hand. Such cursory rejection would be erroneous.''
% Appellant just wants the tribunal to consider the sale price and not reject it out of hand.

This Court mischaracterizes Appellant's complaint about the tribunal's treatment of the subject's sale price. Appellant is not complaining that ``the tribunal erred by rejecting his 2015 purchase price of the
property as determinative of its TCV.'' Opinion at 6. Rather, Appellant's brief at 18-19 complains that the tribunal gave the sale price ``no weight or credibility,'' \reconsiderationDenied[2], contrary to the teaching of \pincite[s]{Jones & Laughlin}{353-354}: ``the price at which an item of
property actually sold is most certainly relevant evidence'' and ``the tribunal's opinion that the evidence `has little or no
bearing' on the property's earlier value suggests that the evidence was rejected out of hand. Such cursory rejection would be erroneous.''
Appellant just wants the tribunal to consider the sale price and not reject it out of hand.

The opinion at 7 asserts that the tribunal ``considered petitioner's evidence of the 2015 purchase price'' and also ``considered the nature of the sale,'' but there is no record of such consideration involving the particular facts of this case. 
The Tribunal gave the sale price ``no weight or credibility'' solely because the seller was HUD.
This amounts to a per se rule which excludes from consideration the sale price of all HUD-owned homes. This is the kind of cursory rejection that \cite[s]{Jones & Laughlin}\ forbids. This is especially troubling because the tribunal cites no authority for this rule beyond its bare speculation that: ``Because the subject was being sold by a government entity, that entity's motivation may
not have been to receive market value for the property.'' \reconsiderationDenied[2].

\section{Relief}

Therefore because this Court's opinion contains palpable errors, Appellant respectfully asks this Court to reconsider or rehear this case.
